*Run bayesian stats in the Azure cloud*

July 2020

This is packge to provide convenience methods around standard cloud practices for running Bayesian models and other code onthe Azure Cloud.   It's a very simple package designed for member of Elise Zipkin lab (MSU iBio) to easily provision and do work on cloud computers when our local HPC is busy

Status

This is in very early stages of development and many R scripts/functions are not complete and just ideas or stubs.   It remains to be seen if this package will be easier to use than simply running the Aure functions from the AzureR library collection directly
